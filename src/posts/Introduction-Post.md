title: Batman Timeline
---

I love reading DC stories and if you're like me, then you enjoy reading comics in the context of other comics. Unfortunalty, DC can't keep a continuity alive even if their life depended on it. I however, have decided to try and sort comic book events into one chronoligical timeline and post it for others to view. Now, if you know anything about DC, then you know there are thousands of characters in their stories and since I would like to **NOT** have brain damage by the end of this project, I've decided to focus on one character for my sake and yours. That character is... Batman.

Use the timeline to navigate through different stories. Each cover will include a summary of what and include any of my own thoughts and reviews.
